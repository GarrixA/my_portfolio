    description: `The Andela Technical Leadership Program is a comprehensive 9-month course designed to equip individuals with both technical and soft skills necessary for success as software engineers.

 

I decided to join this program for several reasons. Firstly, I had been hearing about Andela since 2021, and the positive feedback from those who worked there intrigued me. People often spoke about the benefits, such as the flexibility to work from home, the absence of the daily struggle of commuting, and the financial stability it provided. These aspects appealed to me greatly, especially since I was tired of the daily grind of commuting to my previous job, which required taking two buses. Additionally, my interests in imagination and coding led me to believe that pursuing a career in software engineering would align well with my passions.

 

Upon joining the program, I quickly realized the potential it held for advancing my career. Through rigorous training in JavaScript, data structures, algorithms, Node.js, TypeScript, and CI/CD, I have enhanced my technical skills significantly. Moreover, the program's emphasis on communication and collaboration has helped me develop strong interpersonal skills, which are crucial in the tech industry. Understanding how databases work and integrating backend and frontend components has given me a holistic view of the software development lifecycle, further solidifying my expertise in this field.
